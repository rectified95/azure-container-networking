# The intention of the CODEOWNERS is that a reviewer can be automatically assigned
# to a PR when it is opened instead of needing to be manually assigned or being left 
# unassigned. PRs without assigned Reviewers do not get the prompt attention that 
# they should.
# The CODEOWNERS are not Gatekeepers, just someone who has the domain knowledge to 
# review a PR in an area.
